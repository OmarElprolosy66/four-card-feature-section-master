## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Through this challenge, I improved my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox, which are crucial for creating responsive layouts. Here's a snippet of code I'm proud of:

```css
.hero-sec {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 2rem;
}
```

This grid layout allowed me to create a responsive layout where each card is perfectly aligned and scales well on different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Improving accessibility by ensuring all HTML elements are semantic and well-structured.
- Experimenting with CSS animations and transitions to add subtle visual cues.
